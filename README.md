# Web Photo Source Identification based on Neural Enhanced Camera Fingerprint

## Introduction
Source camera identification of web photos aims to establish a reliable linkage from the captured images to their source cameras, and has a broad range of applications, such as image copyright protection, user authentication, investigated evidence verification, etc. 
Our paper presents an innovative and practical source identification framework that employs neural-network enhanced sensor pattern noise to trace back web photos efficiently while ensuring security. 
The codes for fingerprint extraction network and benchmark dataset with modern smartphone cameras photos are all publicly available in this repo.

## Preparations
* Download the fingerprint extraction network model file and put them under directory `models/ckpts/`.
* Download the RAW photos (about 17G, will be released after paper acceptance) and put them in `data/images/`. 
* Install python requirements in `requirements.txt`.

## Run and Evaluation
Run fingerprint extraction network and save fingerprints in `results/fingerprints`:
```bash
python3 run_extract.py
```

Then run evaluation scripts on above fingerprint file as:
```bash
python3 run_ncc.py
```
You should see the output performance. In the case of single photo registration, the result is
```
- Results locates atï¼š/path/PhotoNecf/results/measures/fingerprints_vs_fingerprints.npy, AUC: 99.80265567168468EER: 1.6559416559416558
```


## Next-step
The following content will also be released after paper acceptance.
- [ ] Release of benchmark dataset containing 1665 RAW photos.
- [ ] Release of Training codes for fingerprint extraction network.
- [ ] Integration codes (including cryptographic schemes).
